How to Import the Education++ Module into your copy of Moodle
=============================================================

1 Place the module folder ("educationplusplus" - make sure it is all lowercase)
  into the /mod folder of the Moodle directory on your Moodle server.

2 Go to Settings > Site Administration > Notifications, you should find
  the module's tables successfully created

3 Go to Site Administration > Plugins > Activity modules > Manage activities
  and you should find that educationplusplus has been added to the list of 
  installed modules.

4 Add to a course by entering the course, turn edit mode on and add a new activity
  and select Education++. We recommened you add it to General, but if you add an
  Education++ to multiple weeks, no worries: your points and rewards are constant 
  across the course
